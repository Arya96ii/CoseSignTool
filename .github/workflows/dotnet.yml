 #### This workflow runs on all platforms and handles three different types of builds:
   # 1. Pull request builds: These are triggered by a pull request. They build and test the code, but do not publish or upload release artifacts.
   # 2. Continuous integration builds: These are triggered by a push to the main branch. They build, test, and publish binaries for local use.
   # 3. Release builds: These are triggered by a release, which is created manually. They build, test, and publish binaries, and then zip and upload them to the release.
