  # The remaining steps run only when changes are pushed to Main, i.e., when a pull request completes.
  # While we could run the publish steps in a parallel job, having them here forces them to wait until the unit tests pass.
  # Another option to explore is to run them in a separate job that depands on ALL of the other jobs passing first.
  # Eventually we might want to tweak the CodeQL job to run on what we already built above so it isn't using resources to autobuild.
